# Purpose

This document outlines the various platform services that are required.

# Overview

## Service manager

*Requirements*:

- Deploy services
- Access logs

*Options*:

- http://kubernetes.io/[Kubernetes]

## Network lookup

*Requirements*:

- Provide interface to lookup devices and services on the network
- Inventory devices and services

*Options*:

- https://coredns.io/[CoreDNS]
- http://www.thekelleys.org.uk/dnsmasq/doc.html[dnsmasq]
- Manually maintain /etc/hosts on workstations

*Questions*:

- Will there be devices that are unable to use DNS?
- What is the expected load on this service? What are the resource
requirements at that load?

## Ingress

*Requirements*:

- Route traffic from devices and debugging stations to services

*Options*:

- https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx[NGINX ingress controller]

*Questions*:

- What is the expected load on this service? What are the resource
requirements at that load?

## Infrastructure monitoring

*Requirements*:

- Allow for administrators to analyze system health
- Monitor service, system and hardware health
- Warn administrators when health checks cross accepted thresholds
- Warn administrators when monitoring service is not healthy

*Options*:

- https://github.com/coreos/prometheus-operator/tree/master/contrib/kube-prometheus[kube-prometheus]

*Questions*:

- Do we want to include monitoring for hardware components on the robot?
- Do we want to include environmental metrics? Wind, visibility, etc?
- In what cases are there fail-over scenarios? Which of these be automated
and triggered by alerts?
- What are the resource requirements of this service?
- Will there be someone at the playa site at all times?

## Detection

*Requirements*:

- Detect poses and faces in audience

*Options*:

Links to available options and relevant research can be found
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eNrWOeiVOmFWQhHKw8vTgIy2nQw7MVz9ZwObrBC-h0k/edit[here]

*Questions*:

- What are we trying to detect?
- What is the interface?
- What is the desired and required latency? What are the resource
requirements to meet those requirements?

## Sensor pre-processing

*Questions*:

- Will there be any pre-processing of sensor output required
(e.g. wind meters, cameras/lasers/etc used for position tracking)?
- What is the interface?
- What is the desired and required latency? What are the resource
requirements to meet those requirements?

## ROS

*Questions*:

- What services will need to be run on servers?
- How will these interface with other services, sensors and devices?
- What are the resource requirements of these services?

## ROS monitoring

*Questions*:

- What services will be need to be run?
- What are the resource requirements of these services?
